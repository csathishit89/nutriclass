# NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data

## 📌 Project Overview
**NutriClass** is a machine learning project focused on classifying food items into appropriate categories using their nutritional composition. The project leverages structured nutritional data such as calories, macronutrients, and other dietary attributes to build a robust multi-class classification model.

This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can assist in food categorization, dietary analysis, and nutrition-based recommendation systems.
